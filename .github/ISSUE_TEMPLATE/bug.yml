      placeholder: Brown beat Thompson to the spot and bodied him up, forcing him to change directions and nearly poking the ball away in the process. Then Brown recovered and used his length to cut off the pass to the corner. Finally, Brown stayed connected as he trailed Thompson on the cut through the lane, then used his athleticism and timing to erase the shot at the rim. Truly remarkable stuff.
