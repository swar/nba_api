# Contributing to the NBA_API

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the NBA_API!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, head over to the [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nbaapi/shared_invite/zt-1gwn1du6v-b1oHTZIXcfEp9E06KdBQNw) to connect with others, chat, and receive help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem? Have a feature request? Identified a missing endpoint? Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of the nba_api you are using

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to occur, versus what you actually occur

* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository that can easily be pull down to recreate the issue locally

  * **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Recreate the issue

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem
