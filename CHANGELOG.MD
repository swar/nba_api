## v1.3.0

Date: 2023-10-04

### Added

#### Endpoints
Eleven new endpoints were added to this release. A massive thank you to @shufinskiy.
- [BoxScoreAdvancedv3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscoreadvancedv3.md)
- [BoxScoreDefensivev2](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscoredefensivev2.md)
- [BoxScoreFourFactorsv3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscorefourfactorsv3.md)
- [BoxScoreHustlev2](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscorehustlev2.md)
- [BoxScoreMatchupsv3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscorematchupsv3.md)
- [BoxScoreMiscv3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscoremiscv3.md)
- [BoxScorePlayerTrackV3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscoreplayertrackv3.md)
- [BoxScoreScoringV3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscorescoringv3.md)
- [BoxScoreTraditionalv3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscoretraditionalv3.md)
- [BoxScoreUsagev3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscoreusagev3.md)
- [PlaybyPlayv3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/playbyplayv3.md)

### Changed

#### NBA JSON schema 
Until recently, the NBA JSON schema followed a tabular strucutre exposing `headers` and `resultSet`. The NBA is now using a nested JSON schema. In addition, the data labels are no longer uppercase (e.g., `PCT_OREB`), are now camelcase and, in many cases, more descriptive (e.g., `percentageReboundsOffensive`).

#### Other
- All NBA player and team data has been updated to the date of this release.
- Corrected an invalid Slack within the text body to match the link present in the Slack shield.
- Updated NBA team data to include the Nuggets 2023 championship (#350)

## Known Issues
Due to the change in the NBA schema, the following methods will currently return and empty dataframe `{}`
- `.get_normalized_dict()`
- `.get_normalized_json()`
- `.get_headers_from_data_sets()`
All other calls are expected to work as expected.

### Removed
The following eleven endpoints have been deprecated by the NBA and subsequently removed from the library
- BoxScoreDefensive --> [BoxScoreDefensivev2](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscoredefensivev2.md)
- BoxScoreMatchups --> [BoxScoreMatchupsv3](docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/boxscorematchupsv3.md)

- [Issue #278](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/issues/278): Fixed `playbyplayregex`, and included updated unit tests, where
  - The NBA removed a space that represented `distance` when `distance` was not included in the made/missed shot.
  - Jump Ball contained a single space in the description (regex now also supports multiple spaces empty description).
  - Team fouls no longer included Player/Referee, just the Team Name & Foul.
