- [Issue #249](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/issues/249): `./nba_api/stats/endpoints/_base.py` requires `numpy` to format data for `get_data_frame`. `numpy` was not in the list of requirements, but is required.
- [Issue #278](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/issues/278): Fixed `playbyplayregex`, and included updated unit tests, where
  - The NBA removed a space that represented `distance` when `distance` was not included in the made/missed shot.
  - Jump Ball contained a single space in the description (regex now also supports multiple spaces empty description).
  - Team fouls no longer included Player/Referee, just the Team Name & Foul.
