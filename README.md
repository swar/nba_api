# nba_api

## An API Client Package to Access the APIs of NBA.com

`nba_api` is an API Client for `www.nba.com`. This package intends to make the APIs of [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/) easily accessible and provide extensive documentation about them.

# Getting Started

`nba_api` requires Python 3.7+ along with the `requests` and `numpy` packages. While `panadas` is not required, it is required to work with Pandas DataFrames.

```bash
pip install nba_api
```

## NBA Official Stats

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import playercareerstats

# Nikola Jokić
career = playercareerstats.PlayerCareerStats(player_id='203999') 

# pandas data frames (optional: pip install pandas)
career.get_data_frames()[0]

# json
career.get_json()

# dictionary
career.get_dict()
```

## NBA Live Data

```python
from nba_api.live.nba.endpoints import scoreboard

# Today's Score Board
games = scoreboard.ScoreBoard()

# json
games.get_json()

# dictionary
games.get_dict()
```
